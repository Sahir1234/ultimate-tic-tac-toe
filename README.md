# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

This was my first independent Java Project that I made using Java Swing to create the GUI. It uses three basic classes and follows an MVC design pattern. There is a model class that controls the game board, a view class that creates the GUI, and a controller class that governs the entire thing. The project creates a small window where users can play the game Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe).
